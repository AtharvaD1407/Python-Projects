# Text to Morse Code Converter

Welcome to the Text to Morse Code Converter! This is a simple, fun, and interactive Python project that allows you to convert your text messages into Morse code.

---

## 📜 How It Works

- The program takes a text input from the user.
- Each character in the input is converted to its corresponding Morse code.
- The Morse code is displayed on the screen.
- The program allows you to repeatedly convert messages until you choose to exit.

## 🚀 Features

- Converts any text (letters, numbers, and special characters) to Morse code.
- Handles spaces between words for readability.
- Beginner-friendly code with comments for learning purposes.
- User-friendly interface to continue or exit the program.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used

This project uses fundamental Python concepts, including:

- Dictionaries: For mapping text characters to their Morse code equivalents.
- Input/Output: To take user input and display the converted Morse code.
- Loops: To process each character in the input string and to allow repeated conversions.
- Conditionals: To check for user choices and handle invalid inputs gracefully.
