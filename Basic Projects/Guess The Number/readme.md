## 📜 How It Works

1. The program generates a random number between a specified range (e.g., 1 to 10).
2. You have to guess the number by typing your guesses.
3. The program provides hints:
   - If your guess is too high, it will say "Too high!"
   - If your guess is too low, it will say "Too low!"
4. Once you guess the number correctly, the program congratulates you and ends the game.
