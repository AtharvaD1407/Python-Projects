# Rock, Paper, Scissors 🎮
Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors game! This is a fun and interactive Python project where you can either challenge your friend or face off against the computer in a best-of-three battle.

## 📜 How It Works
The program allows you to choose between:
- Playing against the computer.
- Playing a two-player game with a friend.

Each round, players choose one of the following options:
- R for Rock
- P for Paper
- S for Scissors

The game uses the classic rules:
- Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors).
- Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cut Paper).
- Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock).

The first to win two rounds in a best-of-three series is declared the winner.

## 🚀 Features

Two Game Modes:
- Play against the computer with random moves.
- Play a two-player game with a friend.

Real-Time Feedback:
- Displays the result of each round (win, lose, or tie).
- Declares the overall winner of the game.

Interactive and User-Friendly:
- Guides players with clear instructions.
- Validates inputs to ensure correct choices.

Best of 3 Format:
- The first player to win 2 rounds wins the game, keeping it short and exciting.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used

This project demonstrates fundamental Python concepts, such as:
1. Random Module:
- Used to generate random moves for the computer.

2. Input/Output:
- Takes user input for choices and displays the results dynamically.

3. Loops:
- Used to handle multiple rounds of gameplay until a winner is determined.

4. Conditionals:
- Logic to compare player choices and determine the outcome of each round.

5. String Manipulation:
- Handles user inputs and ensures they are case-insensitive.

## 🌟 How to Play
1. Run the program in Python.
2. Choose your game mode:
- 1 for playing against the computer.
- 2 for a two-player game.
3. Enter your choices (R, P, or S) when prompted.
4. The game will announce the winner of each round and declare the overall winner after the best-of-three is complete.

Enjoy the game and test your strategy skills against the computer or your friends! 🎉
