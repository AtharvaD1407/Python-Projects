## 🛠️ Concepts Used
This project uses fundamental Python concepts, including:

- Random module: To randomly select a word and its corresponding hint.
- Input/Output: To take user guesses and display the progress of the game.
- Loops: To allow repeated guesses until the word is fully revealed.
- Conditionals: To check if the guessed letters match the word and provide feedback.
- String manipulation: To manage and reveal the guessed letters in the word.
