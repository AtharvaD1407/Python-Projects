## 📜 How It Works

The program generates a random number-based OTP with the specified length.

1. You enter the length of the OTP you want to generate.
2. The program creates a random OTP, ensuring that it contains the exact number of digits you requested.
3. Each digit is randomly selected from 0 to 9, ensuring the OTP is numeric and secure.
4. Once the OTP is generated, it’s displayed to you for use.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used

This project uses basic Python concepts, including:

- **Random module**: To generate random numbers for each digit of the OTP.
- **Input/Output**: To take user input for the OTP length and display the generated OTP.
- **Loops**: To generate each digit of the OTP based on the desired length.
- **Conditionals**: Ensures that the generated OTP follows the desired format (a numeric OTP).
